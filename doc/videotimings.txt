Structure of a 288p video signal
--------------------------------

The A-Video board is designed to generate a YPbPr signal that consists of three separate channels:
The Y signal carries the luminance information together with frame and line sync.
The Pb and Pr signals carry additional colour information (the blue differential and red differential).
Each of the three channels is controled by a simple 5-bit DAC (5 bit plus sync in case of the Y signal) 
made from resistors and that feed into a video amplifier to drive the outgoing line.

The voltage range of the signals is 0 to 700mV for the Pb and Pr channel and 0,300-1000mV for the Y channel
(everything is DC coupled).
By using a different firmware in the FPGA it would also be possible to generate a RGsB signal since this uses
the same voltage ranges.

After experiments and measurements on my LCD TV I found it best to use the following signal structure for a 
50Hz progressive signal (every frame has identical syncs):

Vertical:
    8   lines  frame start syncs 
    17  lines  black
    288 lines  video content (270 visible on my TV)
    312 Total
    
Horizontal lines 0,1,2,6,7 (short syncs):
    2.5  microseconds sync
    29.5 microseconds black
    2.5  microseconds sync
    29.5 microseconds black
    64   Total
Horizontal lines 3,4 (field syncs):
    27.5  microseconds field sync pulse
    4.5   microseconds black
    27.5  microseconds field sync pulse
    4.5   microseconds black
    64    Total
Horizontal line 5 (one field sync, one short sync):    
    27.5  microseconds field sync pulse
    4.5   microseconds black
    2.5   microseconds sync
    29.5  microseconds black
Horizontal (lines 8 - 311):
    4.5  microseconds sync
    6.0  microseconds black (front porch)
    52   microseconds active video (with center at 36.5ms)
    1.5  microseconds black (back porch)
    64   Total


To get square pixels on my test TV (set to 4:3), the pixel clock needs to be 7.31 Mhz.
As a comparision the following devices use these slightly different timings:
ZX Spectrum: 7 MHz 
Atari 800 (PAL): 7.08 MHz
Commodore 64 (PAL): 7.88 Mhz
