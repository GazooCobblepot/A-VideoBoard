Structure of a 288p video signal
--------------------------------

The A-Video board is designed to generate a YPbPr signal that consists of three separate channels:
The Y signal carries the luminance information together with frame and line sync.
The Pb and Pr signals carry additional colour information (the blue differential and red differential).
Each of the three channels is controled by a simple 5-bit DAC (5 bit plus sync in case of the Y signal) 
made from resistors and that feed into a video amplifier to drive the outgoing line.

The voltage range of the signals is 0 to 700mV for the Pb and Pr channel and 0,300-1000mV for the Y channel
(everything is DC coupled).
By using a different firmware in the FPGA it would also be possible to generate a RGsB signal since this uses
the same voltage ranges.

Since 288p was never a real standard, but more a kind of hack many computers and consoles of the time used,
I wanted to create a signal that would be most largely supported. Therefore I will try to reproduce the
signal that is generated by the original Sony Playstation as accurately as possible.

Vertical:
    8   lines  frame start sync pattern
    17  lines  black
    288 lines  video content (270 visible on my TV)
    312 Total
    
Synchronization pulses always start at either the line begin
or exactly in the middle of a line (32 us after line start).
The sync pattern is as follows:
               
	Line 0  |  4.70us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 1  |  2.35us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 2  |  2.35us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 3  | 27.30us                     | 27.30us                      |
	Line 4  | 27.30us                     | 27.30us                      |
	Line 5  | 27.30us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 6  |  2.35us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 7  |  2.35us                     |  2.35us                      |
	Line 8  |  4.70us                                                    |

To get square pixels on my test TV (set to 4:3), the pixel clock needs to be 7.31 Mhz.
As a comparision the following devices use these slightly different timings:
ZX Spectrum: 7 MHz 
Atari 800 (PAL): 7.08 MHz
Commodore 64 (PAL): 7.88 Mhz
