# C64 to YPbPr converter

Instead of designing a modification for the C64, I will try to somehow
build a device that receives the luma and chroma signals from the C64 
A/V output and generates a clean YPbPr signal from it. While there are 
quite some generic S-Video to RGB converters around, none can generate a picture
as clean as should be possible for a dedicated solution.
